[link to data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data "link to data") data are from August, 2019.

The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:

Who uses bikeshare programs?
What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
How much are the bikes used and by whom?

## Summary

In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.

If I were to pursue additional lines of inquiry for analysis and visualization, given the data provided, I would explore:

trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour time-windows, to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods at peak hours;
average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, to explore if there was any difference in male or female or un-gendered riders as they age.

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
