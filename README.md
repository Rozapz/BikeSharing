It can be seen that more advertisements can be done for female users to encourage them to use this program more. Next, let's take a look at the end location of the bikes.

This graph shows that the Manhattan area is the destination for most of the bikes. This area has high traffic and this is showing in the usage of the bikes. Now let's take a look at the time that bikes are used.

This graph shows that most users are using the bikes for less than an hour. Let us get more details and investigate who is using the bikes more, male or female users.

The above graph shows that male users are female users are both using the bikes in a similar way. Next, let us take a look at the rush hour time and see if we can find a relation between bike use and time of the day during weekdays.

As it can be seen, our assumption of the local users who use the bike to beat the traffic is correct. Now, let us do a similar study and this time separate male and female users.

this graph clearly shows that more advertisement is needed for female customers to start using bikes for daily commutes. Lastly, let us study the subscribers' use of the bikes compared to other customers.

As it can be seen, subscribers are local users and they use the bike on work days to beat the traffic. The rest of the customers are tourists that are visiting New york city.


## Summary

In conclusion, bike-share service is popular in New york city. This popularity is mostly in the Manhattan area, this area has high tourist attractions and at the same time high traffic. Therefore, its users are both tourists and locals. Using rental bikes to arrive at their destination is a great way to beat traffic for locals and this can be seen in the heatmap for weekdays.

Additional analysis and visualization that can be explored are:

  - Average trip duration, by birth year can be used to understand which age group could be targeted for advertisements.
  - Trip starting and ending locations can help find where the bikes should be distributed and help the company to move the bikes to where riders start their trip.
