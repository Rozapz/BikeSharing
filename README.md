# Bike Sharing App Data Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to get a detailed analysis on the customers who use the bike sharing app. It is important for us to undrestand who are the daily users of the bikes, their destination, weekday distribution of usage and more. This analysis is done in Tableau and you can find the [link to dashboard here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/roza7019/viz/challenge1_16795182396430/NYCBikeShareing?publish=yes "link to dashboard").

The data used in this analys is from August 2019 and the data can be found here [link to data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data "link to data")

## Summary

In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.

If I were to pursue additional lines of inquiry for analysis and visualization, given the data provided, I would explore:

trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour time-windows, to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods at peak hours;
average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, to explore if there was any difference in male or female or un-gendered riders as they age.

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
